What You Need to Do
You must pull and merge or pull and rebase to integrate the remote changes first.

🔧 Option 1: Merge (Simple and Safe)
bash
Copy
Edit
git pull --no-rebase
git push -u origin main
OR, set it as your default so you don't get asked again:

bash
Copy
Edit
git config pull.rebase false
⚙️ Option 2: Rebase (Keeps cleaner history, but needs careful handling)
bash
Copy
Edit
git pull --rebase
git push -u origin main
